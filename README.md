# Physics
A gravity simulator built for my physics class. 

The engine takes bodies of a set mass, loads then to a coordinate system, centers the display around the center of mass of the system, and set the bodies loose. Every body holds a initial velocity and acceleration. 

There are a few preset situations and the user has the ability to add and remove bodies.
